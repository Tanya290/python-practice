#DQL (Data Query Language) is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used for querying and retrieving data from a database. The primary command in DQL is `SELECT`, which is used to fetch data from one or more tables.
#The basic structure of a `SELECT` statement is:

#SELECT column1, column2, ...
#FROM table_name
#WHERE condition
#ORDER BY column

#Key Components

1. #SELECT: Specifies the columns to retrieve.
2. #FROM: Specifies the table(s) from which to retrieve the data.
3. #WHERE: Filters the rows based on a specified condition.
4. #ORDER BY: Sorts the result set by one or more columns.

#Examples

#1.Selecting All Columns
#To retrieve all columns from a table:

#SELECT * FROM employees;
#This query fetches all columns from the `employees` table.

#2.Selecting Specific Columns
#To retrieve specific columns:
#SELECT first_name, last_name, department
#FROM employees;
#This query fetches the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `department` columns from the `employees` table.

#3.Using WHERE Clause
#To filter rows based on a condition:
#SELECT first_name, last_name
#FROM employees
#WHERE department = 'Sales';


#This query fetches the `first_name` and `last_name` of employees who work in the 'Sales' department.

#4.Ordering Results
#To sort the result set:
#FROM employees
#ORDER BY salary DESC;

#This query fetches the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `salary` columns from the `employees` table and sorts the results by `salary` in descending order.

#5.Using Aggregate Functions
#To perform calculations on data:

#SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
#FROM employees
#GROUP BY department;


#This query calculates the average salary (`AVG(salary)`) for each department and groups the results by `department`.

#6.Joining Tables

#To retrieve data from multiple tables:
#SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
#FROM employees e
#JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

#This query fetches the `first_name` and `last_name` from the `employees` table and the `department_name` from the `departments` table, joining the two tables on the `department_id`.


#DQL is a powerful subset of SQL that enables users to query and retrieve data from a database efficiently. By mastering the `SELECT` statement and its various components, users can perform complex data retrieval operations to meet their specific needs.
